Tip:
Click into your address bar in file explorer, type "cmd", then press enter. This will open a command prompt within the folder, meaning you won't need to cd to the directory.

IMPORTANT:
Make sure you open the tiled project within Tiled! If you skip this, object properties will not display properly.

Reference Guide:

Markers have IDs, this ID tells the game what the marker is used for. These are the current ones we know:
- 0: The AI sends builders here to look for trees.
- 3: The AI seems to build around here.
- 6: The AI seems to use this area to build shipyards.
- 7: Horizontal bridge.
- 8: Vertical bridge.

Entities have a sub-index. This is only really used for pickups. These are the current ones we know:
- 5: Red Brick
- 6: Minikit
- 7: Blue Stud
- 8: Golden Brick
- Other: Mission Pickup
